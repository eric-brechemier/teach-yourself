## Seeing

[Empedocles][1] thought that flames were projected from our eyes to light
the objects that we see. We [now know][2] that we see the light reflected
from objects towards our eyes, but Empedocles's explanation still makes
sense from a subjective point of view.

Try opening your eyes without looking at anything, just with a blank stare,
lost in the void. Light may be entering your eyes, but it is only when
you project your attention here and there that you start seeing things.
This is a motivated performance, which triggers eye movements and requires
some effort. And after looking intensely for a while, we may even fail our
eyes strain and burn from all the effort.
