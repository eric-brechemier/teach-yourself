# The Conditions of Learning, 4th edition, by Robert M. Gagné

To illustrate the different steps of the theory of instruction
presented by Robert M. Gagné in this book, I imagine a mother
talking to her young son:

    Look at this river.
    You already know how to cross the street.
    Today, you will learn how to cross the river.
    This is a bridge; it starts here and ends there.
    A bridge is like a zebra crossing, a safe place to cross a river.
    Try to cross the bridge, I am watching.
    Good, now come back the same way. That's it.
    You can cross another bridge further down the river tomorrow.
    Take any of these two bridges on your way back from school.

Each of the sentences in the above story illustrate a step
of the instruction process.

3 steps **before** the instruction starts:

  * *Look at this river.* Attract the attention
  * *You already know how to cross the street.* Bring prerequisites to memory.
  * *Today, you will learn how to cross the river.* Announce learning outcome

4 steps **during** the instruction:

  * *This is a bridge; it starts here and ends there.* Present learning material.
  * *A bridge is like a zebra crossing, a safe place to cross a river.* Suggest encoding for memorization.
  * *Try to cross the bridge, I am watching.* Practice learning outcome.
  * *Good, now come back the same way. That's it.* Provide feedback during learning.

2 steps **after** the instruction:

  * *You can cross another bridge further down the river tomorrow.* Evaluate learning outcome.
  * *Take any of these two bridges on your way back from school.* Practice regularly.

I chose the image of a bridge as a symbol of the instruction process itself,
which allows the learners to bridge the gap between what they already know
and what they can achieve through learning.
